# Chapter 15 : Layout
**There is Two type of elements:**
- Block-Level Elements
- Inline Elements
**If one block-level element sits inside another block-level element then the outer box is known as the containing or parent element.**
**Position of elements**
- Normal Flow : `positiion : static`
- Relative positioning : `position : relative`
- Absolute positioning : `position : absolute`
**box offset**
- Fixed positioning : `position : fixed`
- floating positioning : `position : z-index`

**Screen Size**
> Different visitors to your site will have different sized screens that show different amounts of information, so your design needs to be able to work on a range of different sized screens.

**Screen Resolution**
> Resolution refers to the number of dots a screen shows per inch. Some devices have a higher resolution than desktop computers and most operating systems allow users to adjust the resolution of their screens.

**Page Sizes**
> Because screen sizes and display resolutions vary so much, web designers often try to create pages of around 960-1000 pixels wide 

**Fixed Width Layouts**
> Fixed width layout designs do not change size as the user increases or decreases the size of their browser window. Measurements tend to be given in pixels.

**Liquid Layouts**
> Liquid layout designs stretch and contract as the user increases or decreases the size of their browserwindow. They tend to use percentages.

**Layout Grids**
> Composition in any visual art (such as design, painting, or photography) is the placement or arrangement of visual elements â€” how they are organized on a page. Many designers use a grid structure to help them position items on a page, and the same is true for web designers.

**CSS Frameworks**
> CSS frameworks aim to make your life easier by providing the code for common tasks, such as creating layout grids, styling forms, creating printer-friendly versions of pages and so on. You can include the CSS framework code in your projects rather than writing the CSS from scratch.
