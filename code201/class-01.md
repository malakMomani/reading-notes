## HTML 

### How the Web Works ? 
> When you visit a website, the web server
hosting that site could be anywhere in the
world. In order for you to find the location of
the web server, your browser will first connect
to a Domain Name System (DNS) server
 
- **HTML Describes the Structure of Page**
- **HTML Uses Elements to Describe the Structure of Pages**
- **Tags act like containers. They tell you something about the information that lies between their opening and closing tags.**
- **Opening tags can carry attributes, which tell us more about the content of that element.** 

- **DOCTYPES** tell browsers which version of HTML you are using.
- You can add comments to your code between the **<!-- and -->** markers.
- The **id** and **class** attributes allow you to identify particular elements.
- The **<div>** and **<span>**  elements allow you to group block-level and inline elements together.

-  **<iframe>** : like a little window that has been cut into your page — and in that window you can see another page.
- **< meta>** : lives inside the <head> element and contains information about that web page.

- **The success process can use when you creating a new website :**

```
>> Know and understand who your target audience.
>> What the audience need and why .
>> How the audience visit your website.
>> When your audience are likely to return.
>> Create a diagram or map for your website.
>> Group your pages based on inforamtion its provide.
>> sketch your wireframe.
>> Make a good visual design to getting your message by Prioritizing and Organizing.
>> Use visual hierarchy (font size , font color , font style and images) because most users just contrast on what they want.
>> Design a CONCISE CLEAR SELECTIVE navigation.
```

# JavaScript

**JavaScript is a programming language used in browsers to make websites more interactive ,interesting, and user-friendly**

### How JavaScript makes web pages more interactive ?
1. Access your web page Content by selecting an element
2. Modify the content like adding or removing elements
3. Program rules which allows the browser to access or change content
4. React to events like when a button is pressed.

> **Slideshows** & **Forms** are examples of JavaScript in web page 

- **A script is a series of instructions that the computer can follow in order to  achieve a goal.** 

## Start programming
first you need to state your goal then list the tasks that need to be completed in order to achieve it. After you determine your goal , you can work out the individual tasks needed to achieve it , and each on has a sequence of steps , these steps will be our code nearly. Every step for every task you've written ,needs to be written
in a language the computer can understand and follow.

## Programming concepts 
**Naming Variables**:
- The name must begin with a letter , ($) or (_) . it's musn't start with a number.
- The name can contain letters, numbers,($), or (_). Note that you must not use a (-) or a (.) in a variable name.
- You can't use keywords or reserved words.
- Case sensitive.
- You should use a meaningful name.
- If your variable name is made up of more than one word, use a capital letter for the first letter of very word after the first word. 

**Arrays**:  is a special type of variable. It doesn't just store one value; it stores a list of values. 
> Values in an array are accessed as if they are in a numbered list. It is important to know that the numbering of this list starts at zero (not one). 

**Experssions** : Evaluates into (results in) a single value. Broadly speaking.
- Two Types :
  - Expressions that just assign a value to a variable .
  - Expressions that use two or more values to return a single value .

  **Operators**
  - (.) dot operator : call operator.
  - (=) assignment operator : assign a value to a variable.
  - (>,<,==,!=) : comparison operator : Compare two values and return true or false.
  - (*,-,+,/,) Arithmetic operators : math
  - (&&) logical operators : Combine expressions and return true or false.
  - (+) string operators : Combine two strings .

**Events**
> WHAT IS AN EVENT?
There are common ways in which people interact with each type of object. For  example, in a car a driver will typically use at least two pedals. The car has been designed to respond differently when the driver interacts with each of the different pedals:
• The accelerator makes the car go faster
• The brake slows it down

**Methods**
> Methods represent things people need to do with objects. They can
retrieve or update the values of an object's properties. 

**HOW A BROWSER SEES A WEB PAGE**
1. RECEIVE A PAGE AS HTML CODE 
2. CREATE A MODEL OF THE PAGE AND STORE IT IN MEMORY
3. USE A RENDERING ENGINE TO SHOW THE PAGE ON SCREEN

**The HTML < script > element is used in HTML pages to tell the browser to load the JavaScript file (rather like the < link > element can be used to load a CSS file**
