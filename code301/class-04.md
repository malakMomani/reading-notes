- endword$ -> matches a string that ends with `endword`
^word endword$ -> exact string match (starts and ends).
roar -> matches any string that has the text roar in it
- () -> Capturing group.
- [] -> match any character in set.
- A-Z -> match a charcter from A to Z
- \w -> Matches any word character (alphanumeric & underscore)
- + -> Matches 1 or more of the preceding token.
