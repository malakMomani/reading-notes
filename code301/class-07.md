- Understanding and influencing group norms were the keys to improving Google’s teams.

- **Good Teams**
  - had high average social sensitivity

`We had lots of data, but there was nothing showing that a mix of specific personality types or skills or backgrounds made any difference. The ‘‘who’’ part of the equation didn’t seem to matter`

`As long as everyone got a chance to talk, the team did well. But if only one person or a small group spoke all the time, the collective intelligence declined.`

## REST 

**Roy Fielding** : He helped write the first web servers, that sent documents across the Internet

**How does the web work?** : by HTTP , tells the browser what protocol to use and the url describe the location of sth anywhere in the world from anywhere in the world.

**HTTP** : is all about applying verbs to nouns. For instance, when you go to a web page

**REST** : Architectural style provides a definition of a “resource”, which is what those things point to. The whole world wide web is built on

**A web page is a resource?** : Kind of. A web page is a “representation” of a resource. Resources are just concepts. URLs--those things that you type into the browser...

**What does URL do?** : tells the browser that there's a concept somewhere. this concepts that people are calling *Web Service* or *API*

**polymorphism** : That's a geeky way of saying that different nouns can have the same verb applied to them.
