# What is Git?
``` 
Git is type of DVCS (Distributed Version Control systems) which allowed 
programmers to have more knowledge of team membersâ€™ activities with certain 
files, and gave administrators much more control over divvying up revision 
privileges with backups.

There is three main states for Git
1. Committed.
2. Modified.
3. Staged.
```
### The local Git repository has three components:

- Working Directory.
- Index.
- Head.

```
All files in a checked out (or working) copy of a project file are either 
in a tracked or untracked state.
```

## Life Cycle 
```
Untracked Project  >> Add file >> Unmodified project you remove file >> Edit File
>> Modified Project >>  Stage File >> Staged project you can commit it 
and return to Modified Project.
```

```
Finally , you can stash any change you made it ,using ( git stash apply ).
