How to sove problems ?

1. **Understand** the problem
2. **Plan** your solution
3. **Divide** your problem to sub-problem and solve each sub-problem separately
4. And if **stuck** take a deep breath and :
   - **Debug** : go step by step through your solution trying to find where you went wrong.
   - **Reassess** : Take a step back. Look at the problem from another perspective. Is there anything that can be abstracted to a more general approach?
   - **Research** : Google it !!
5. **Practice** , Practice , Practice.
