# Graphs

**Graph :** is a non-linear data structure that can be looked at as a collection of vertices (or nodes) potentially connected by line segments named edges.

**Vertex** - A vertex, also called a “node”, is a data object that can have zero or more adjacent vertices.
**Edge** - An edge is a connection between two nodes.
**Neighbor** - The neighbors of a node are its adjacent nodes, i.e., are connected via an edge.
**Degree** - The degree of a vertex is the number of edges connected to that vertex.

There are two types of graphs based on the edges :

- **Directed :**  also called a Digraph is a graph where every edge is directed.

- **Undirected :** is a graph where each edge is undirected or bi-directional. This means that the undirected graph does not move in any direction.

There are 3 types based on how connected the graphs are to other node/vertices.

- **Complete :** is when all nodes are connected to all other nodes.

- **Connected :** is graph that has all of vertices/nodes have at least one edge.

- **Disconnected** graph is a graph where some vertices may not have edges.

- **Acyclic** graph is a directed graph without cycles.

- **Cyclic** graph is a graph that has cycles.

- **Weighted Graphs** is a graph with numbers assigned to its edges. These numbers are called weights.
