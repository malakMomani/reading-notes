2. **What’s the difference between a framework and a library?**
   A **library** is essentially a set of functions that you can call, these days usually organized into classes. Each call does some work and returns control to the client.

   A **framework** embodies some abstract design, with more behavior built in.
   > In Library, your code is going to call the Library whereas, in Framework, your code is being called by Framework.
