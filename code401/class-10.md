# Stack and Queue

**What is Stack :** is a data structure, consists of Nodes. Each Node points to the next Node, but does not points to its previous.

- *push* : add element of the end of the list
- *pop*: remove the last element of the list
- *peek*: view the last element in the list

**FILO**
First In Last Out
**LIFO**
Last In First Out

**What is a Queue** : same as Stack, but use FIFO and LILO concepts

**FIFO**
First In First Out
**LILO**
Last In Last Out

- *Enqueue* - Nodes or items that are added to the queue.
- *Dequeue* - Nodes or items that are removed from the queue.
- *Front* - points to the front/first Node of the queue.
- *Rear* - points to the rear/last Node of the queue.
- *Peek* - view the front element in the list
- *IsEmpty* - returns true when queue is empty otherwise returns false.
