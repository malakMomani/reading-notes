## Chapter 17 : HTML5 Layout

**HTML5 is introducing a new set of
elements that help define the structure of
a page.**

1. **<header>** : appear in the top of web page
2. **<footer>** : appear in the bottom of web page
3. **<nav>** : contain main navigational blocks , look like navigation bar.
4. **<article>** : container for any section of a page that could stand alone and potentially be syndicated.
5. **<aside>** : 
   - if it's inside <article> taq : contain information that is related to the article but not essential to its overall meaning.
   - if it's outside <articlt> tag : it acts as a container for content that is related to the entire page.
6. **<section>** : groups related content together.
7. **<hgroup>** : heading group , group together a set of one or more <h1> through <h6> elements so that they are treated as one single heading.
8. **< figure><figcaption >** : contain any content that is referenced from the main flow of an article , and should also contain a  a <figcaption> element which provides a text decription for the content of the < figure> element.

9. **<div>** : will remain an important way to group together related elements.
10. **< a >** : go into a link.

> The new HTML5 elements i XX ndicate the purpose of
different parts of a web page and help to describe
its structure.

2. **< !-- -->** : comments in HTML.
3. **id attribute** : < tag id="value">  It is used to uniquely identify that element from other elements on the page. Its value should start with a letter or an underscore.
4. **class attribute** : < tag class ="value" > identify several elements as being different from the other elements on the page.
5. **Block elements** : <h1>, <p>, <ul>, and <li> that mean each tag will appear in a new line.
6. **Inline elements** : < a>, <b>, <em>, and <img> appear to continue on the same line as their neighbouring elements.
7. **<div>** : Grouping Text & Elements In a Block.
8. **< span>** : Grouping Text & Elements Inline,
9. **<iframe>** : like a little window that has been cut into your page — and in that window you can see another page.
10. **< meta>** : lives inside the <head> element and contains information about that web page.
